Developers can deploy their existing contracts to the zkEVM, and users can deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain. For moving assets across chains, you will need to use the zkEVM Bridge. The bridge interface is available in the [**Wallet Suite**](https://wallet.polygon.technology/). 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to bridge assets from Ethereum Mainnet to Polygon zkEVM and vice-versa.

You can either follow the **step-by-step guide** or watch the **video tutorial** provided below.

On the right hand side of the page, you can view the recent transactions, including transactions that are pending.

After you proceed with transaction on the bridge, Metamask will ask you to confirm it.
